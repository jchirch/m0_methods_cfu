# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
    - I'm proud of how much I've retained from the lectures this week. 
    - When I compare my current self completing the CFUs vs my past self (like when I tried a few Try Turing! classes and felt completely lost) and see how far I've come it feels great!
    - Even if I don't initially know how to complete an exercise, I can at least start it and reliably get 90% of the way in completing it.
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
    - Methods can complete almost any task and once they're written they can be re-used indefinitely. This saves tons of time and energy we can devote to making even more powerful tools/applications.
